# trap3
A transpiling applicaton for converting cambridge pseudocode to python


## Installation instructions
Download the executables from the releases tab. While the wrapper application is not required to make the base trap3 application to function, it is recommended to download that as well unless you are comfortable with inputting parameters from the command line.

## Compilation instructions
For windows users, having a c/c++ compiler installed and running the make.bat files for both the main and the wrapper programs are sufficient.
